# Student-gradebook-arrayList

This program compounds on the first project I did in Data Structures and Algorithms. The first project was to create two classes: 
Student and GradeItem.

This project I am now reading data from a text file, parsing the data into an array and then depending what the data says,
either create a new Student object or GradeItem object. 

Lastly, this program will format the given data and output a report to a file.
